Sauerbomber - README - MILESTONE 2
==================================

 == Warning: It's not like a typically ego shooter gamemode, but please be open minded! ==


The Idea: A Bomberman Gamemode
------------------------------

A small group of sauerbraten players are going to implement a bomberman like gamemode on
base of the cube engine. Why? Because we loved bomberman and thought it would be a great
extension to sauerbraten. The cube engine provides most of what's needed: a 3d engine,
players, items, mapmodels, weapons and so on. So the implementation of a bomberman like
gamemode shouldn't be that hard.

But also, we thought, we should make it closer to sauerbraten than to the original
bomberman. Firstly, unlike bomberman it's played in a 3d environment in first person.
Secondly, it should be possible to do some actions that needs some experience and skills
like weaponjumps in other gamemodes.


Technical View
--------------

In the bomberman gamemode we implemented a new weapon: the bomb. Unlike other weapons,
you get the bomb back if it exploded. So you have to wait, before dropping a bomb again.
Also unlike other weapons players cannot go through bombs. The players are colliding with
the bomb and have to make a detour. Also, as previously mentioned, players needs some
skills in throwing a bomb. Firstly they can throw the bomb further or shorter. Secondly,
using bombs they are able to climb.

Furthermore in the bomberman gamemode there are some items players can collect. The bombs
item provides players a second, third, ... bomb they can drop concurrently. The bombradius
item lets the bomb explosion radius get bigger. An the bombdelay item shortens the time
before the bomb explodes.

There is another thing to mention: there is a new entity type called obstacle. In the
bomberman gamemode players can damage obstacle like barrels or boxes. If the health is
lower than the damage, the obstacle explodes. Unlike boxes or barrels obstacles doesn't
move if hit (no hitpush). Also unlike boxes and barrels, obstacles does not start in
falling mode. That means that obstacles are flying. The behaviour in this case is like
normal mapmodels. Unlike barrels but like boxes, obstacles are not cause damage to other
entities or players.


Milestone 2 Artwork
-------------------

The second milestone of sauerbomber contains some new artwork:

* Some models for use as obstacles
* The Hudgun
* 42 maps (see CREDITS)


Known Bugs
----------

* LAG if there are many bombs (caused by many network messages)
* Some bombs are invisible, if there are many bombs (cause not known)
* Performance issues (caused by bomb collision with obstacles)
* Performance issues if there are many obstacles


Servers
-------

We have setup some servers:

 -+----------------+------------------+--------+--------------------------+-
  . name           . hostname         . port   . purpose                  .

What happend on the original goal?
----------------------------------

Our goal was, that the bomberman gamemode become an official gamemode in sauerbraten. Sadly,
eihrul doesn't accept the bomberman gamemode for sauerbraten. According to eihrul,
Sauerbomber is a "completely different game". So, what to do? We never wanted to fork
sauerbraten, but we have to if we want to go on.
